# AI_Based_Crop_Recommendation
# 🌾 AI Regression-Based Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent **AI-powered crop recommendation model** built using **regression algorithms** that dynamically suggests the most suitable crop based on **real-time soil parameters** such as humidity, temperature, and pH level. Developed using **Visual Studio Community** with a focus on precision agriculture and sustainable farming.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural planners in selecting the optimal crop for cultivation by analyzing:
- 🌡️ **Temperature**
- 💧 **Humidity**
- 🧪 **Soil pH Level**

The **recommendations vary dynamically** based on these inputs, making the system highly adaptable to real-time environmental conditions.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a smart agriculture solution using machine learning that:
- Recommends the best crop for given soil conditions
- Helps maximize yield and minimize waste
- Enables data-driven decision-making in farming

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Tools

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Community
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
- **Model Type**: Machine Learning - Regression (Linear, Polynomial)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a **custom CSV dataset** that includes:
- Soil temperature
- Humidity level
- pH value
- Crop label (recommended crop)

You can replace the dataset with your region-specific data for localized recommendations.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Input**: User provides temperature, humidity, and pH level of the soil.
2. **Processing**: Regression model analyzes the input values.
3. **Output**: The system dynamically recommends the best-fit crop.

> ✔️ If any parameter changes, the recommendation will adapt accordingly in real-time.

Temperature: 27°C
Humidity: 70%
pH Level: 6.5
Recommended Crop: Rice 🌾
